# Mock-Search-App

## Introduction
  - The goal of this project was to create a Next.js application that displays the foundational features of Next.js (server-side  rendering, routing with the pages folder, etc). I wanted to further develop my skills in Tailwind CSS to give the app responsive design, experiment with the Mapbox API and utilize Material UI for date & calendar functionality.
